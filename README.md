# CAThe validator showed me several errors. Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections, or else use a div element instead for any cases where no heading is needed. - after checking on the forum, it's not a big mistake.
Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values. - I tried to delete the slashes, but VSC returned them by itself.
Overall, I am very pleased with the results, although a few things could be done better. While working on the project, I used help from:

https://css-tricks.com/
https://www.youtube.com/
and, of course, school materials as well as some tips from the Udemy course
